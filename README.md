# ACC2019MixedAutonomy
This repository contains the matlab functions used to produce our numerical study of ACC submission. Among them, "opt_AV_gu.m", "AV_gu.m" and "opt_AV.m" is taking in n, \xi, \beta, and k as variables, and provide an optimal solution with optimal profit. Notice that "opt_AV_gu.m" and "AV_gu.m" are using yalmip toolbox and gurobi solver. "opt_AV_gu.m" is providing the optimal solution if mixed-autonomy is used, while "AV_gu.m" is providing the optimal solution if only autonomous vehicles are used. "opt_AV.m" is a cvx function that corresponds to the alternative optimization problem. "optimal_p_noAV.m" is the function that takes in n, \xi and \beta, while producing the optimal solution without autonomous vehicles. "S2C_matrix.m" is a helper function that produce the matrix for a star-to-complete network. Feel free to contact me at qinshuang@gatech.edu if you have any questions.
